gitosis (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix initial push syntax in README. Needs to say "refs/heads/".
  * Clean up more files in debian/rules.
  * Mark the generated egg as non-zip-safe.
  * Ensure "git init" doesn't write to stdout, and confuse a push.
    The repository autocreation functionality ends up sending the
    stdout to the client side, and there a very confused git push
    can't make any sense of the protocol.
  * Adjust README to make adduser create the home directory.
  * Avoid missing configuration file trouble on initial run
    of gitosis-init (and hence, gitosis-run-hook).
  * Allow using email address in SSH public key user fields.
  * Make sure ~git/.ssh exists in gitosis-init.
